I’m sorry to say that your generous Christmas gift was not put towards its intended purpose, but instead used to purchase a small camera that I can put in my pocket and take everywhere. I just don’t have the space in my current apartment for more cookware—as much as I wish that I did. But, because I know you’re interested, I’ve included a photo of my <em>“favorite”</em>
piece: an <strong>AUS-ION™ 26cm carbon-steel frying pan</strong>
, taken on the aforementioned camera. It’s due for a re-seasoning, but still works pretty well. My only issue is that it is <em>damn heavy!</em>
Especially for carbon steel.
