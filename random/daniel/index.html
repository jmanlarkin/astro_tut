<p>Daniel,</p>
<p>I’m sorry to say that your generous Christmas gift was not put towards its intended purpose, but instead used to purchase a small camera that I can put in my pocket and take everywhere. I just don’t have the space in my current apartment for more cookware—as much as I wish that I did. But, because I know you’re interested, I’ve included a photo of my <em>“favorite”</em> piece: an <strong>AUS-ION™ 26cm carbon-steel frying pan</strong>, taken on the aforementioned camera. It’s due for a re-seasoning, but still works pretty well. My only issue is that it is <em>damn heavy!</em> Especially for carbon steel.</p>

<p>Anyway, it means a lot that you would think of me. I hope that we find ourselves together soon, in person, to discuss more about all things: cookware and more.</p>
<p>Love,<br>
<strong>Jonathan</strong></p>
<p>P.S. What is the favorite piece of your kitchen collection?</p>
