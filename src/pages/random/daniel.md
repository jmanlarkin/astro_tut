Daniel,  

I’m sorry to say that your generous Christmas gift was not put towards its intended purpose, but instead used to purchase a small camera that I can put in my pocket and take everywhere. I just don’t have the space in my current apartment for more cookware—as much as I wish that I did. But, because I know you’re interested, I’ve included a photo of my *"favorite"* piece: an **AUS-ION™ 26cm carbon-steel frying pan**, taken on the aforementioned camera. It’s due for a re-seasoning, but still works pretty well. My only issue is that it is *damn heavy!* Especially for carbon steel.

Anyway, it means a lot that you would think of me. I hope that we find ourselves together soon, in person, to discuss more about all things: cookware and more.  

Love,  
**Jonathan**  

P.S. What is the favorite piece of your kitchen collection?
